# Timer Logic Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Timer will close in 0 seconds" Notification
**Root Cause**: Warning alarms were being scheduled incorrectly and notifications were showing even when no meaningful time remained.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added input validation in `NotificationManager.createTimerWarningNotification()` to reject `secondsLeft <= 0`
- Modified warning alarm scheduling to only create alarms if there's meaningful time (at least 6 seconds)
- Added 5-second minimum threshold in alarm listener before showing warning notifications
- Added debug logging to track when warnings are skipped

### 2. Tab Not Closing When Timer Elapses
**Root Cause**: Alarm scheduling and management issues could cause timers to become stale or not fire properly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Improved alarm clearing to clear both warning and close alarms in all timer operations
- Fixed alarm scheduling logic to prevent race conditions
- Enhanced error handling and logging for tab closure attempts
- Added proper warning alarm rescheduling for extend/fast-forward operations

### 3. Input Validation and Error Handling
**Enhancements**:
- Added comprehensive input validation to all NotificationManager methods
- Added proper error handling with custom error messages
- Enhanced debug logging throughout the notification system
- Added input sanitization for notification parameters

### 4. Security Improvements
**Added**:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to manifest.json
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Proper error handling to prevent information leaks

## Technical Details

### Warning Alarm Logic
```javascript
// Before: Always scheduled, could be 0 or negative
const warnDelayMin = Math.max(0, (duration - warningTime) / 60);
chrome.alarms.create('warnTab_' + tabId, { delayInMinutes: warnDelayMin });

// After: Only scheduled if meaningful
if (duration > warningTime) {
  const warnDelayMin = (duration - warningTime) / 60;
  if (warnDelayMin >= 0.1) { // At least 6 seconds
    chrome.alarms.create('warnTab_' + tabId, { delayInMinutes: warnDelayMin });
  }
}
```

### Notification Validation
```javascript
// Added to createTimerWarningNotification()
if (typeof secondsLeft !== "number" || isNaN(secondsLeft) || secondsLeft <= 0) {
  this.debug(`Not showing warning notification: secondsLeft is ${secondsLeft}`);
  return;
}
```

### Alarm Management
- All timer operations now clear both warning and close alarms before creating new ones
- Warning alarms are properly rescheduled when timers are extended or fast-forwarded
- Added minimum threshold check in alarm listener

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test short timers** (< 60 seconds) to ensure no "0 seconds" notifications appear
2. **Test warning threshold** - set warning to 60 seconds, timer to 30 seconds, verify no warning shows
3. **Test timer completion** - verify tabs actually close when timers expire
4. **Test pause/resume** - verify timers work correctly after being paused
5. **Test extend/fast-forward** - verify warning alarms are rescheduled properly

## Files Modified

1. `notification-manager.js` - Added input validation and error handling
2. `background.js` - Fixed alarm scheduling and management logic
3. `manifest.json` - Added Content Security Policy

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve reliability of the timer system.
